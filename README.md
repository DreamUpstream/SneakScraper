- Then "npm run assets:watch"
- Finally, open a second terminal and run "npm run server:dev"
- Edit your index page in public/index.html | JS in resources/js/app.js | CSS or SASS in resources/sass/app.scss, assets recompile after you save them!
- If you want to add more routes in your server e.g. /about, you can add them in routes/ directory (check routes/index.js for an example)
